\section{General Reporting Features}

Most reports in TACC are available from the TACC main menu from the
{\emph Reports} menu.

All reports within TACC have a consistent layout with the following items:
\begin{itemize}
\item A Date bar.  If a report allows a specific date range, the date
bar will be available at the top of the report.
\item The Report Title.  This will usually contain the title of the
report and possibly the dates displayed or other report specific
information.
\item The Report Body.  This contains the actual report data, specific
to each report.  Most reports can be sorted by clicking on the column
header.  Double clicking an item in the report body will usually "drill
down" to the item detail or open the corresponding Customer's window.
This functionality varies from report to report.
\item Control Buttons.  The buttons vary from report to report, the
following buttons are usually available:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Filters} - Brings up a list of filters to customize the
appearance or contents of the report.
\item {\bf Refresh} - Forces the report body to be repopulated.
\item {\bf Print} - Brings up a print dialog allowing the report to be
printed to a printer or file.
\item {\bf Email} - Brings up an email dialog that allows you to enter
the email address you wish the report to be sent to, optionally
including a plain-text formatted report and CSV file which is suitable
for importing into a spreadsheet program such as Excel or OpenOffice
Calc.
\item {\bf Close} - Closes the report.
\end{itemize}
Reports can also have additional control buttons specific to that
particular report.
\end{itemize}
