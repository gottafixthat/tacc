\section{General Ledger Report}

The General Ledger Report in TACC has the ability to display all items
that are posted into the General Ledger in both summary and detail form.

It is accessed from the {\emph Reports} menu by selecting {\emph General
Ledger}.  When first accessed, the report will display a summary of all
of the accounts in the Chart of Accounts and summarize the transaction
amounts for the current month.  See figure
~\ref{fig:GeneralLedgerReport} on page
~\pageref{fig:GeneralLedgerReport} for a sample General Ledger Report.

The General Ledger Report displays the following columns:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Account} - This is the account number defined in the Chart of
Accounts (see ~\ref{Chart of Accounts} on page ~\pageref{Chart of Accounts}
for additional information).
\item {\bf Name} - The name of the account as defined in the Chart of
Accounts.
\item {\bf Type} - The type of account as defined in the Chart of
Accounts.
\item {\bf Amount} - What has posted to this account during the date
range specified in the report's Date Bar.
\end{itemize}

To view the individual transactions for a General Ledger account, double
click on the report item.  This will create a General Ledger detail
report for the selected account with the dates specified in the Date
Bar.
