general reporting features as well as some of the reports specific to
accounting.

\section{General Ledger Report}

The General Ledger Report in TACC has the ability to display all items
that are posted into the General Ledger in both summary and detail form.

It is accessed from the {\emph Reports} menu by selecting {\emph General
Ledger}.  When first accessed, the report will display a summary of all
of the accounts in the Chart of Accounts and summarize the transaction
amounts for the current month.  See figure
~\ref{fig:GeneralLedgerReport} on page
~\pageref{fig:GeneralLedgerReport} for a sample General Ledger Report.

\end{figure}

The General Ledger Report displays the following columns:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Account} - This is the account number defined in the Chart of
Accounts (see ~\ref{Chart of Accounts} on page ~\pageref{Chart of Accounts}
for additional information).
\item {\bf Name} - The name of the account as defined in the Chart of
Accounts.
\item {\bf Type} - The type of account as defined in the Chart of
Accounts.
\item {\bf Amount} - What has posted to this account during the date
range specified in the report's Date Bar.
\end{itemize}

To view the individual transactions for a General Ledger account, double
click on the report item.  This will create a General Ledger detail
report for the selected account with the dates specified in the Date
Bar.

\section{General Ledger Detail Report}

The General Ledger Detail Report displays all of the transactions that
have posted to a GL account for the specified date range.

When first opened, the default GL Detail Report displays a default set
of columns, not all of which may be available for the particular GL
account being displayed:  Date, Amount, Customer ID, Statement, Full
Name, Contact Name, Billable Name, Package Name.  As with most other
reports, the Date Bar will allow you to change the date range to
display.  If there is a Customer ID associated with the GL item, double
clicking on the item will open the selected customer window.

GL Detail Reports can be customized to change what information can be
displayed, and in which order the columns will appear.  To change the
report, click on the {\emph Filters} control button in the control bar.

\end{figure}

This will bring up a new window that will allow you to customize the
report.  Additionally, you can save the report filters and quickly
retrieve them for any GL Detail report.

To add or remove columns from the report display, select or deselect
them from the list of {\emph Display Columns} with a single left mouse click.

To re-order the columns, click on the column you want to move in the
{\emph Display Columns} list then click the {\emph Move Up} or {\emph
Move Down} button to change its position in the list.  You may need to
click the item a second time if your selection changed.

Click the {\emph Update} button and the report will be refreshed with
the new layout.

To save the both the order and selected columns for future use, enter
a name for the saved filters in the {\emph Saved Filters} box and click
{\emph Save}.  If there is already a set of saved filters with that name you
will be prompted to verify that you wish to replace it.  When the
filters are successfully saved, a status message will appear briefly on
the main TACC window.

To load a set of saved filters, click the down arrow on the {\emph Saved
Filters} box and select the name you entered when you saved it.  After
you have selected the filter, click the {\emph Load} button and it will
be applied to the current report.  You may then make any changes to the
filters and click {\emph Save} again to update the saved filters.
